# POV GoalMap — TODO

> Status as of 2026-06-24. Branch `master`, working tree clean.
> Full context lives in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

## 🔜 Next up (do first)
- [ ] **Activate the live-scores backend on Vercel.** Code is shipped (`f711b18`);
      it only runs once the site is on Vercel. User steps: deploy to Vercel (B/C
      in DEPLOY.md), set env var `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` (DEPLOY.md §E), point
      povatlas.com DNS at Vercel. Until then the frontend uses the TheSportsDB
      fallback (already live).

> ⚙️ **Deploy policy:** auto build + deploy after every completed change (don't
> ask each time) — `npm run build` + robocopy mirror (HANDOFF §10).

## 📦 Medium priority
- [ ] **Knockout stage** (Round of 32 → Final). Only the 72-match group stage is
      modelled in `src/data/matches.ts`; standings/stats don't cover knockouts.
- [ ] **Refresh fixture scores** in `src/data/matches.ts` near/after real
      matchdays — current scores are a snapshot, some illustrative.
- [ ] **Replace illustrative Golden Boot tallies** in `src/data/topScorers.ts`
      with real data if desired (currently labelled illustrative in the UI).

## 🧊 Low priority / stretch
- [ ] **Improve live data (optional).** Backend `/api/live-scores` (API-Football +
      TheSportsDB fallback) is built. Follow-ups: auto-fetch Golden Boot scorers;
      surface goal-scorer events (already in `Match.live.events`) in the match
      detail; grow the alias table if a fixture fails to map; add a 3rd provider.
- [ ] **Expose the Leaflet map on `window` in dev** so the easter egg can be
      triggered from `preview_eval` (see Known bug #1 in HANDOFF).
- [ ] **Add tests / ESLint.** Currently the only check is `npm run lint`
      (`tsc --noEmit`) + manual browser verification.

## ✅ Done this session
- [x] `/api/live-scores` backend (Vercel Edge): API-Football primary +
      TheSportsDB fallback, 60s cache, key via env, pluggable providers; frontend
